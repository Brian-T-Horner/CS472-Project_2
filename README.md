Boston University CS - 472 Project 2

Cache simulation written in C++

--- Project Details ---

You are to design and implement a software simulation of a cache memory subsystem. You can
use any language. Note that any real cache is invisible to software. This will be a simulation of
the way that a real cache works. Your "cache" will be a software structure/class that will
contain information similar (but on a smaller and more simplified scale) to what would be in a
real cache. Your "main memory" will be a 2K array. You will implement a direct-mapped, write-back cache. The block size will be 16 bytes and you'll
have 16 slots.


Tests included in .txt file but hardcoded into program for ease of convience.
